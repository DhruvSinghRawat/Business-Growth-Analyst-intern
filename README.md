ðŸ”‘ What This Is

This is my take on Boardroom Lab: Growth Engineering via Prompted Strategy.
The idea was to think like a growth architect, not just read dashboards.

ðŸ§  What I Did

AI Prompts: Wrote 2 prompts using AIDCA and persuasion principles to make B2B emails personal and action-oriented.

Funnel Fixes: Found where leads were dropping, wrote new prompts to fix tone, trust gaps, and weak CTAs.

Dashboard Idea: Simple wireframe to show funnel metrics, AIDCA stage drops, and next steps for leadership.

Strategy: Turned bulk email campaigns into signal-based stories that move people to action.
